# sudofox/fartpack


<h2 align="center">Welcome to the new Minecraft Crystal PvP meta.</h2>

Fartpack is extremely lightweight, hilarious, and pulls no punches.

Fartpack is rapidly improving; a release candidate is available for testing.

## Version support

- Minimum tested version: 1.12.2 *Not tested with firework sounds.
- Maximum tested version: 1.18.1

This pack uses resourcepack format 4, but has a few tweaks to make it work with older versions such as 1.12.2.                                                    
*I'll be (or at least try to be) working closely with Sudofox to keep it this way.

## Features

- Non-intrusive: overrides just the essentials and lets you use your other packs as you wish.
- Fart sound effects for explosions
- Synced totem pop sound effect
- End crystal items look like end crystals
- Brand new custom bedrock and obsidian textures
- Easy-to-see block breaking animation

## Showcase

Soonâ„¢

## TODO

- Write a build system to target specific Minecraft versions to avoid duplication of assets
- Make obsidian a bit less purple

## Thanks

- SwordL on the Sudomemo Discord - made the original joke pack that I based this on
